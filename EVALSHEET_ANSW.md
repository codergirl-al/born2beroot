### If you aren't able to explain what you did, do it again. Don't cheat.

#### How does a virtual machine work?
- Virtual machines are a vizualization of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionaliy of a physical computer.

#### Debian vs CentOS and why
- CentOS -> Red Hat entreprise, RPM package format, supports less filesystems, only version updates are allowed, large community support.
- Debian -> free upstream distribution, DEB package format and dpkg/APT as pckg manager, more filesystems allowed, allows upgrades from one stable release to the other.

I ended up choosing Debian because it's easier to use and overall more supported. CentOS is a more professional distribution leaning to the red hat side.

#### Purpose of a virtual machine
- A virtual machine is used to have the ability to run multiple applications together, to have isolation between applications and for legacy apps which run on older OSes.

#### Difference between aptitude and apt. What is APPArmor?
- Aptitude and APT are both used/related to package management. APT is designed to handle software installation and removal as a command-line tool.
